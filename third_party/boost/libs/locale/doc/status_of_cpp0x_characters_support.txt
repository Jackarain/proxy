\page status_of_cpp0x_characters_support Status of C++11 char16_t/char32_t support

The support of C++11 \c char16_t and \c char32_t is experimental and is not
intended to be used in production until various compiler/standard library flaws are fixed.

Many recent C++ compilers provide decent support of C++11 characters, however often:

-# 	The standard library does not install any std::locale::facets for this support so any attempt
    to format numbers using \c char16_t or \c char32_t streams would just fail.
-#	The standard library misses specialization for required \c char16_t/char32_t locale facets,
	so "std" backends is not build-able as essential symbols missing, also \c codecvt facet
	can't be created as well.

\section status_of_cpp0x_characters_support_msvc Visual Studio

MSVC provides all required facets since VS 2010 however:

-# 	The standard library does not provide installations of std::locale::id for these facets
	in DLL so it is not usable with \c /MD, \c /MDd compiler flags and requires static link of the runtime
	library.
-#	\c char16_t and \c char32_t are not distinct types but rather aliases of unsigned short and unsigned
	types which contradicts to C++11 requirements making it impossible to write \c char16_t/char32_t to stream
	and causing multiple faults.

If you want to build or test Boost.Locale with C++11 char16_t and char32_t support
you should pass `define=BOOST_LOCALE_ENABLE_CHAR32_T define=BOOST_LOCALE_ENABLE_CHAR16_T` to `b2` during build and define `BOOST_LOCALE_ENABLE_CHAR32_T` and `BOOST_LOCALE_ENABLE_CHAR32_T` when using Boost.Locale
