= Ranges

Thus far the rules we have examined have one thing in common; the values they produce are fixed in size and known at compile-time.
However, grammars can specify the repetition of elements.
For example consider the following grammar (loosely adapted from
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.1[rfc7230,window=blank_]):

[source,cpp]
----
chunk-ext      = *( ";" token )
----

The star operator in BNF notation means a repetition.
In this case, zero or more of the expression in parenthesis.
This production can be expressed using the function cpp:range_rule[], which returns a rule allowing for a prescribed number of repetitions of a specified rule.
The following rule matches the grammar for __chunk-ext__
defined above:

[source,cpp]
----
include::example$unit/doc_grammar.cpp[tag=code_grammar_4_1,indent=0]
----

This rule produces a cpp:range[], a __ForwardRange__ whose value type is the same as the value type of the rule passed to the function.
In this case, the type is cpp:string_view[] because the tuple has one unsquelched element, the cpp:token_rule[].
The range can be iterated to produce results, without allocating memory for each element.
The following code:

[source,cpp]
----
include::example$unit/doc_grammar.cpp[tag=code_grammar_4_2,indent=0]
----

produces this output:

[source,cpp]
----
johndoe
janedoe
end
----

Sometimes a repetition is not so easily expressed using a single rule.
Take for example the following grammar for a comma delimited list of tokens, which must contain at least one element:

[source,cpp]
----
token-list    = token *( "," token )
----

We can express this using the overload of cpp:range_rule[] which accepts two parameters: the rule to use when performing the first match, and the rule to use for performing every subsequent match.
Both overloads of the function have additional, optional parameters for specifying the minimum number of repetitions, or both the minimum and maximum number of repetitions.
Since our list may not be empty, the following rule perfectly captures the __token-list__ grammar:

[source,cpp]
----
include::example$unit/doc_grammar.cpp[tag=code_grammar_4_3,indent=0]
----

The following code:

[source,cpp]
----
include::example$unit/doc_grammar.cpp[tag=code_grammar_4_4,indent=0]
----

produces this output:

[source,cpp]
----
johndoe
janedoe
end
----

In the next section we discuss the available rules which are specific to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[rfc3986,window=blank_].
