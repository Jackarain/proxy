[[msmcommonhpp]]

= Common headers

== msm/common.hpp

This header provides one type, wrap, which is an empty type whose only
reason to exist is to be cheap to construct, so that it can be used with
mpl::for_each, as shown in the Metaprogramming book, chapter 9.

template <class Dummy> wrap\{};

[[msmrow_tagshpp]]

== msm/row_tags.hpp

This header contains the row type tags which front-ends can support

description of the different types.
