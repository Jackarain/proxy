== Boost 1.90

* feat: The documentation has been refurbished, it is now built with Antora

[[boost-185]]

== Boost 1.85

it as default.
* New front-end (PlantUML). Requires C++ 20
* Div. bugfixes

[[boost-172]]

== Boost 1.72

* Merged from develop new implementation of deferred events
* Div. bugfixes

[[boost-157]]

== Boost 1.57

* Fixed BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT_WITH_ATTRIBUTES (broken in 1.56).
* Fixed execute_queued_events, added execute_single_queued_event
* Fixed warnings for unused variables

[[boost-156]]

== Boost 1.56

* Bugfix: no_transition in case of an exception.
* Bugfix: Trac 9280
* Bugfix: incomplete namespace names in eUML

[[boost-155]]

== Boost 1.55

* New feature: interrupt states now support a sequence of events to end
the interruption
* Bugfix: Trac 8686.

[[boost-154]]

== Boost 1.54

* Bugfix: Exit points broken for the favor_compile_time policy.
* Bugfix: copy breaks exit points of subsubmachines.
* Bugfix: Trac 8046.

[[from-v223-to-v224-boost-151]]

== From V2.23 to V2.24 (Boost 1.51)

* Support for `boost::any` or `kleene` as an acceptable event.
* Bugfix: compiler error with fsm internal table and `none`(compound)
event.
* Bugfix: `euml::defer_` leading to stack overflow.

[[from-v222-to-v223-boost-150]]

== From V2.22 to V2.23 (Boost 1.50)

* `eUML` : better syntax for front-ends defined with eUML as transititon
table only. Caution: Breaking Change!
* Bugfix: graph building was only working if `initial_state` defined as
a sequence
* Bugfix: flags defined for a Terminate or Interrupt state do not break
the blocking function of these states any more.
* Bugfix: multiple deferred events from several regions were not working
in every case.
* Bugfix: visitor was passed by value to submachines.
* Bugfix: `no_transition` was not called for submachines who send an
event to themselves.
* Fixed warnings with gcc

[[from-v221-to-v222-boost-148]]

== From V2.21 to V2.22 (Boost 1.48)

* eUML: added easier event reprocessing: `process(event_)` and
`reprocess()`
* Rewrite of internal transition tables. There were a few bugs (failing
recursivity in internal transition tables of sub-sub machines) and a
missing feature (unused internal transition table of the main state
machine).
* Bugfixes
** Reverted favor_compile_time policy to Boost 1.46 state
** `none` event now is convertible from any other event
** eUML and pseudo exit states
** Fixed not working Flag_AND
** Fixed rare bugs causing multiple processing of the same event in a
submachine whose transition table contains this event and a base event
of it.
** gcc warnings about unused variables
* Breaking change: the new internal transition table feature causes a
minor breaking change. In a submachine, the "Fsm" template parameter for
guards / actions of an internal table declared using
`internal_transition_table` now is the submachine, not the higher-level
state machine. Internal transitions declared using internal rows in the
higher-level state machine keep their behavior (the "Fsm" parameter is
the higher-level state machine). To sum up, the internal transition
"Fsm" parameter is the closest state machine containing this transition.

[[from-v220-to-v221-boost-147]]

== From V2.20 to V2.21 (Boost 1.47)

* Added a `stop()` method in the back-end.
* `Added partial support for Boost.Phoenix functors in eUML`
* Added the possibility to choose when `state switching` occurs.
* Bugfixes
** Trac 5117, 5253, 5533, 5573
** gcc warnings about unused variables
** better implemenation of favor_compile_time back-end policy
** bug with eUML and state construction
** incorrect eUML event and state macros
** incorrect event type passed to a direct entry state's on_entry action
** more examples

[[from-v212-to-v220-boost-146]]

== From V2.12 to V2.20 (Boost 1.46)

* Compile-time state machine analysis using mpl_graph:
** `checking of region orthogonality`.
** `search for unreachable states`.
** `automatic region index search for pseudo entry or explicit entry states`.
* `Boost.Parameter interface definition` for msm::back::state_machine<>
template arguments.
* `Possibility to provide a container` for the event and deferred event
queues. A policy implementation based on a more efficient
Boost.CircularBuffer is provided.
* msm::back::state_machine<>::is_flag_active method made const.
* added possibility to `enqueue events` for delayed processing.
* Bugfixes
** Trac 4926
** stack overflow using the Defer functor
** anonymous transition of a submachine not called for the initial state

[[from-v210-to-v212-boost-145]]

== From V2.10 to V2.12 (Boost 1.45)

* Support for `serialization`
* `Possibility to use normal functors` (from functor front-end) in eUML.
* `New constructors` where substates / submachines can be taken as
arguments. This allows passing arguments to the constructor of a
submachine.
* Bugfixes

[[from-v20-to-v212-boost-144]]

== From V2.0 to V2.12 (Boost 1.44)

* New documentation
* Internal transitions. Either as part of the transition table or using
a state's internal transition table
* increased dispatch and copy speed
* `new row types` for the basic front-end
* new eUML syntax, better attribute support, macros to ease developer's
life. Even VC8 seems to like it better.
* New policy for reduced compile-time at the cost of dispatch speed
* Support for base events
* possibility to choose the initial event
