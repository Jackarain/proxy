Subscript_

if_then_else_(Condition,Action1,Action2)

Returns either the result of calling Action1 or the result of calling
Action2

If_Else_

if_then_(Condition,Action)

Returns the result of calling Action if Condition

If_Then_

while_(Condition, Body)

process_(Event [,fsm1] [,fsm2] [,fsm3] [,fsm4])

Processes Event on the current state machine (if no fsm specified) or on
up to 4 state machines returned by an appropriate functor.

Process_

process2_(Event, Data [,fsm1] [,fsm2] [,fsm3])

Processes Event on the current state machine (if no fsm specified) or on
up to 2 state machines returned by an appropriate functor. The event is
copy-constructed from what Data() returns.

Process2_

is_flag_(Flag [,fsm])

Calls is_flag_active() on the current state machine or the one returned
by calling fsm.

Get_Flag_

event_ [(attribute name)]

Returns the current event (as const reference)

GetEvent_

source_ [(attribute name)]

Returns the source state of the currently triggered transition (as
reference). If an attribute name is provided, returns the attribute by
reference.

GetSource_

target_ [(attribute name)]

Returns the target state of the currently triggered transition (as
reference). If an attribute name is provided, returns the attribute by
reference.

GetTarget_

state_ [(attribute name)]

Returns the source state of the currently active state (as reference).
Valid inside a state entry/exit action. If an attribute name is
provided, returns the attribute by reference.

GetState_

fsm_ [(attribute name)]

Returns the current state machine (as reference). Valid inside a state
entry/exit action or a transition. If an attribute name is provided,
returns the attribute by reference.

GetFsm_

substate_(state_name [,fsm])

Returns (as reference) the state state_name referenced in the current
state machine or the one given as argument.
