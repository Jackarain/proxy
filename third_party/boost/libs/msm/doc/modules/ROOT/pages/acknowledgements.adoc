= Acknowledgements

I am in debt to the following people who helped MSM along the way.

[[msm-v2]]

== MSM v2

* Thanks to Dave Abrahams for managing the review.
* Thanks to Eric Niebler for his patience correcting my grammar errors.
* Special thanks to Joel de Guzman who gave me very good ideas at the
BoostCon09. These ideas were the starting point of the redesign. Any
time again, Joel. ☺
* Thanks to Richard O’Hara for making Green Hills bring a patch in less
than 1 week, thus adding one more compiler to the supported list.
* Big thanks to those who took the time to write a review: Franz Alt,
David Bergman, Michael Caisse, Barend Gehrels, Darryl Greene, Juraj
Ivancic, Erik Nelson, Kenny Riddile.
* Thanks to Matt Calabrese, Juraj Ivancic, Adam Merz and Joseph Wu for
reporting bugs.
* Thanks to Thomas Mistretta for providing an addition to the section
"What do you actually do inside actions / guards".

[[msm-v1]]

== MSM v1

* The original version of this framework is based on the brilliant work
of David Abrahams and Aleksey Gurtovoy who laid down the base and the
principles of the framework in their excellent book, ``C++ Template
Metaprogramming''. The implementation also makes heavy use of the
boost::mpl.
* Thanks to Jeff Flinn for his idea of the user-defined base state and
his review which allowed MSM to be presented at the BoostCon09.
* Thanks to my MSM v1 beta testers, Christoph Woskowski and Franz Alt
for using the framework with little documentation and to my private
reviewer, Edouard Alligand.
