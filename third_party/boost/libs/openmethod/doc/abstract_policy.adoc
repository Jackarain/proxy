### Synopsis

Defined in <boost/openmethod/policies/basic_policy.hpp>.

```c++
namespace boost::openmethod::policies {

struct abstract_policy {};

}

### Description

`abstract_policy` is a required base class for a policy. It makes it possible
for metafunctions such as `use_classes` to discriminate between user classes
and the (optional) policy class.
