# The target for MrDocs simply includes all symbols defined in all
# headers with the appropriate compilation options.
# Nothing else should be included in the MrDocs configuration or
# would be useful to MrDocs.
#
# This single source file not only includes all symbols (the source
# files do not collectively include all headers) but also makes MrDocs
# run much faster than relying on the entire library.
#
# The time to extract the declarations went from ~8m6s to ~3s in our
# experiments: a 162x speedup while including all symbols!
#
# In practice, this special target is simply emulating the
# default behavior of the standardese tool with MrDocs, which
# requires the user to clearly specify the targets via the
# compilation database.
#
# The BOOST_OPENMETHOD_MRDOCS_BUILD=ON is the only option we usually need
# here.
# The other options are set just to ensure other targets are
# ignored even if these options are set as ON in the cache.
