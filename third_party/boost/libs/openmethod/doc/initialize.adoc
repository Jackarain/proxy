## initialize

### Synopsis

Defined in `<boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp>`.

```c++
namespace boost::openmethod {

template<class Policy = BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY>
auto initialize() -> /*unspecified*/;

}
```

### Description

Initializes dispatch data for the methods registered in `Policy`. This function
must be called before any calls to those methods, and after loading or unloading
a dynamic library that adds classes, methods or overriders to `Policy`.

The return value is an object that contains a member variable, `report`, that
contains the following information:

* `std::size_t cells`: the number of cells used by the v-tables and the multiple
dispatch tables.

* `std::size_t not_implemented`: the number of methods that don't have an
overrider for at least one combination of virtual arguments.

* `std::size_t ambiguous`: the number of methods that have more than one
overrider, none of which is more specific than the others, for at least one
combination of virtual arguments.

## finalize

### Synopsis

Defined in `<boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp>`.

```c++
namespace boost::openmethod {

template<class Policy = BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY>
auto finalize() -> void;

}
```

### Description

De-allocates the resources allocated by `initialize` for the `Policy`, including
resources allocated by the policys in `Policy`. Resources are de-allocated in an
arbitrary order. It is not necessary to call `finalize` between calls to
`initialize`. It is provided mainly for the benefit of memory leak detection
schemes.
