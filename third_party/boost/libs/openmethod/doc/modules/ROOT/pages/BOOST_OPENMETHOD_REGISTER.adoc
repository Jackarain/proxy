## Synopsis

Defined in link:{{BASE_URL}}/include/boost/openmethod/macros.hpp[<boost/openmethod/macros.hpp>].

```c++
BOOST_OPENMETHOD_REGISTER(TYPE);
```

## Description

Creates a registrar for `TYPE`, i.e. a static `TYPE` object with a unique
generated name. At static initialization time, the object adds itself to a list:
methods and class registrations add themselves to a cpp:registry[], and
overriders add themselves to a method's overrider list.
