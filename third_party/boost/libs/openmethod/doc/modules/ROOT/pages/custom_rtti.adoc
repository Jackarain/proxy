[#custom_rtti]

The original motivation for the policy mechanism is to make it possible to
interface OpenMethod with custom RTTI systems.

Stock registries use the `std_rtti` implementation of `rtti`.
Here is its full source:

[source,c++]
----
struct std_rtti : rtti {
    template<class Registry>
    struct fn {
        template<class Class>
        static constexpr bool is_polymorphic = std::is_polymorphic_v<Class>;

        template<class Class>
        static auto static_type() -> type_id {
            return &typeid(Class);
        }

        template<class Class>
        static auto dynamic_type(const Class& obj) -> type_id {
            return &typeid(obj);
        }

        template<typename Stream>
        static auto type_name(type_id type, Stream& stream) -> void {
            stream << boost::core::demangle(
                reinterpret_cast<const std::type_info*>(type)->name());
        }

        static auto type_index(type_id type) -> std::type_index {
            return std::type_index(
                *reinterpret_cast<const std::type_info*>(type));
        }

        template<typename D, typename B>
        static auto dynamic_cast_ref(B&& obj) -> D {
            return dynamic_cast<D>(obj);
        }
    };
};

* `is_polymorphic` is used to check if a class is polymorphic.
  This template is required.

* `static_type` is called during class registration, by
    `virtual_ptr`{empty}s "final" constructs.
    It is also called to set `bad_call::method`.
    This function is required.

* `dynamic_type` is used to read the dynamic type of a virtual argument.
  If only the `virtual_ptr` "final" constructs are used, or if
  `boost_openmethod_vptr` is provided for all the classes in the registry,
  this function can be omitted.

* `type_name` writes a representation of a type to a
   `LightweightOutputStream`.
   It is used to format error and trace messages.
   This function is optional; if it is not provided, _type_ is rendered as
   "type_id(_type_)".

* `type_index` returns an object that _uniquely_ identifies a class.
    Some forms of RTTI (most notably, C{plus}{plus}'s `typeid` operator) do not
    guarantee that the type information object for a class is unique within
    the same program.
    This function is optional; if not provided, `type` is assumed to be
    unique, and used as is.

* `dynamic_cast_ref` casts an object to a class.
    It takes a reference, and returns a reference of the same category (and
    cv-qualifier if applicable) as `B`.
    This function is required only in presence of virtual inheritance.

Let's rewrite the Node example using several variations of custom RTTIs.

In the first example, we use a "static" scheme, where the type ids are
compile-time constants:

[source,c++]
----
include::{example}/1/custom_rtti.cpp[tag=classes]
----

Let's define a `rtti` policy for this scheme. We are going to replace the
default registry globally, so we do _not_ include `<boost/openmethod/core.hpp>`
or `<boost/openmethod.hpp>` - only what we need to implement the policy:

[source,c++]
----
include::{example}/1/custom_rtti.cpp[tag=policy]
----

The policy's notion of "polymorphic" is different from C{plus}{plus}'s. Here, a
class is "polymorphic" if it derives from `Node`, meaning that `dynamic_type`
can extract the _runtime_ type of a virtual argument. In fact, this policy does
not require Node to be polymorphic in the C++ sense. If we remove the virtual
destructor and implement `value` as an open-method as well, the program will
still work.

The policy is quite minimal. It does not support virtual inheritance, because it
does not provide a `dynamic_cast_ref` function. It would not produce good error
or trace messages, because it does not provide a `type_name` function. Instead,
it relies on the `type_name` inherited from cpp:rtti::defaults[]. It
renders types as adorned integers, e.g. "type_id(2)". All non-"polymorphic"
types would be rendered the same way, as "type_id(0)".

cpp:rtti::defaults[] also provides a default implementation for `type_index`,
which simply returns its argument.

Now we need a policy to get a v-table pointer from an object. Our RTTI system
has an interesting property: its type ids are monotonically allocated in a
small, dense range. It means that we can use them as indexes in a vector.
`vptr_vector` is perfect for that. So here is our registry:

[source,c++]
----
include::{example}/1/custom_rtti.cpp[tag=registry]
----

Defining macro
xref:BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY.adoc[BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY]
sets the default registry used by all library components that need one.

Next, we include the main header.
Because `BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` is defined, its value is used
for the default registry.

The rest of the example is unchanged.

## Deferred RTTI

In the previous example, the RTTI system assigns type ids statically. Another
popular approach is to allocate type ids using a global counter, manipulated by
static constructors. Like so:

[source,c++]
----
include::{example}/2/custom_rtti.cpp[tag=classes]
----

The type ids are assigned in another translation unit:

[source,c++]
----
include::{example}/2/custom_rtti.cpp[tag=type_ids]
----

This is a problem, because `static_type` is called by
`BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES`, also during static construction. There no guarantee
regarding the order of execution of static constructors across several
translation units. `BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES` risks reading the type ids
_before_ they have been assigned.

The solution is to derive the rtti policy from `deferred_static_rtti`. Doing so
postpones reading the type ids until `initialize` is called:

[source,c++]
----
include::{example}/2/custom_rtti.cpp[tag=policy]
