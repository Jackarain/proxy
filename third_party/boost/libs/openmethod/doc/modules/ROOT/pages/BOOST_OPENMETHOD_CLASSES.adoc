# BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES

## Synopsis

Defined in link:{{BASE_URL}}/include/boost/openmethod/macros.hpp[<boost/openmethod/macros.hpp>].

```c++
BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(CLASSES...[, REGISTRY]);
```

## Description

Registers `CLASSES` in REGISTRY.

NOTE: The default value for `REGISTRY` is the value of
`BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` when `<boost/openmethod/core.hpp>` is
included. Subsequently changing it has no retroactive effect.

This macro is a wrapper around cpp:use_classes[]; see its documentation for more
details.
