## deferred_static_rtti

### Synopsis

Defined in <boost/openmethod/policies/basic_policy.hpp>.

```c++
namespace boost::openmethod::policies {

struct deferred_static_rtti : rtti {};

}
```

### Description

`deferred_static_rtti` is a policy that defers collection of static type ids.

Some custom RTTI systems rely on static constructors to assign type ids.
OpenMethod itself relies on static constructors to register classes, methods and
overriders, calling the `static_type` function from the `rtti` policy in the
process. This can result in collecting the type ids _before_ they have been
initialized. Adding this policy to a policy moves the collection of type ids to
`initialize`.
